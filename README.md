# Heart Disease Classification (Machine Learning)
# Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally and early detection and prevention are paramount to avoid the onset of such diseases.  To detect and diagnose such diseases, healthcare practitioners must possess a wealth of data which will dictate the outcome of the patientâ€™s health status. More than often, the process of analyzing these data can be cumbersome. Machine learning provides novel and effective solutions to such issues. Its ability to help decision making and anticipate illness risk is one of its applications in healthcare.
